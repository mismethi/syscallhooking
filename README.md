# SyscallHook
This project is based on InfinityHook by Nick Peterson (https://github.com/everdox/InfinityHook). It allows you to monitor and hook system calls, much like the original project, but it has been updated with workarounds for Microsoft's fixes in Windows 10 20H1. This works on a similar concept to InfinityHook, however, it is a completely different project.
